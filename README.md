Numerical Analysis
===================

These are the codes for the Num Al lab I had last semester. Since it was college work *and* written in C++, you'll find some really bad piece of code in there. 

The codes were written in **Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Express** and thus have the `stdlib` header included on top. You'll have to edit it out if you compile it using some other compiler.
